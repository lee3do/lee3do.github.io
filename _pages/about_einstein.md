I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Agri Econ at the University of Jon. As an applied microeconomist, my research focuses on international trade, with a particular emphasis on examining the impact of trade remedy and sunset review policies on U.S. trade. I work as a research assistant in Dr. Albert's research group and have presented papers at AAEA, CEA, ASHEcon, and NAREA. I am also an instructor of record at the University of Jon for the senior-level course ECON 4321.

I'm in the 2023-24 job market, and I'll be presenting my work at the 2023 IATRC. My job market paper examines the effects of the implementation of anti-dumping and countervailing duties, imposed between 1992 and 2018, on US agricultural imports.
